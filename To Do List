To Do List

- 	fix connection edges being in between the cut off, so currently each time a tier up happens links are removed and added back and forth as it is inbetween cutoffs

-	fix feelers to arc correctly

-	adjust delivery speeds

- 	use points to add more effects e.g. circling tentacles or nodes

-	other AI Improvements?

	-	slow down enemy AI -add a decision timer and only act when it reaches 0, starting even at 10 seconds? purple could be lower too

	-	make AI oppose when attacked

	-	let AI cut points vary, depending on populations?

	-	make AI judge differences after moving the distance or ignore while moving? never cancel while on route?

	-	make AI go for the best option when given many possible options e.g. if powerful, not just the first checked options e.g. furthest away node

-	add upto level 15

-	add upto level 20

-	add scoring, only based on timer? or 

-	add power limits to levels

-	add power limits to editor
	-	and to level saving

-	pause when window in background?

-	still a rare opposition issue, maybe only when one is latched, sometimes slip past each other  --- related to the random mid points appearing because the opposed connection is pointing to the wrong place so the midpoint is between them

-	add music?

-	add sounds?

-	make mute button functional

-	Improve menu

	-	menu transition fade

-	fix the look of the editor
